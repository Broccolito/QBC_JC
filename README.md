## All of Us Research Program Genomic Data Overview

### About the Project

This repository provides an overview and critical analysis of the genomic data collected in the "All of Us" Research Program, as presented by Wanjun Gu. The project aims to advance personalized medicine and medical research by utilizing a vast and ancestrally diverse database. It focuses on integrating genetic data with electronic health records (EHR) to bridge the gap between clinical and research data.

### Features

- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Information on the demographic and genetic diversity within the "All of Us" Biobank, including physical measurements, survey responses, EHRs, wearables, and genomic data.
- **Ancestral Diversity Analysis**: Detailed analysis using UMAP and admixture plots to visualize the genetic backgrounds of participants.
- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**: Frameworks for analyzing correlations, including GWAS and PheWAS, with case studies on LDL-C and the Duffy blood group locus.
- **Controversy Discussion**: Examination of the complexities surrounding race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry in the context of genetic research, highlighting methodological considerations and potential biases.
